        <h1 className='header'>WHAT IS AN IOP?</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>Our IOP enables patients to continue their day-to-day regimen while simultaneously undergoing our best possible care. Measured on a case-by-case basis, patients may live in our treatment center, in a sober living community, or at their own home.
        <br /> <br/>
        If the patient has a strong, supportive family and group of friends/peers, they will be able to undergo care with us, but also be able to live at home. </p>
        <br />
        <p>At Contra Costa Rehab, we recognize that overcoming mental illness on your own may not be possible. Fortunately our treatment programs give you the path to healing/recovery. Through our intensive outpatient program, we give you the tools to manage your mental health in the most healthy way possible. To learn more, reach out to us today.</p>

        <h1 className='header'>WHY CHOOSE AN IOP?</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>It is common for those struggling with addiction to not respond well to  residential treatment options. An intensive outpatient program may be the best alternative, as it can offer a high level of care and more accountability (removing patients from access to drugs/alcohol, enabling peers, etc.).
        <br /> <br/>
        If the patient has a strong, supportive family and group of friends/peers, they will be able to undergo care with us, but also be able to live at home. </p>
        <br />
        <h1 className='header'>WHAT TO EXPECT THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>Considered our mid-tier intensive care, the program consists of 3 hours of clinical services 3-5 days per week. Patients also participate in group therapy sessions (2 per day) with any additional sessions available if deemed necessary. We also offer several other therapeutic options, such as:</p>
